## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in various domains, particularly in education. These models, such as GPT-3 and BART, have the potential to enhance learning experiences, provide personalized educational content, and facilitate communication between students and educational systems. However, the deployment of LLMs also raises significant concerns regarding fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. This project aims to explore these challenges and develop solutions that ensure equitable outcomes in AI-driven learning environments.

## Problems Addressing
The project focuses on several critical issues:

- **Bias in Training Datasets**: Many LLMs are trained on datasets that may not adequately represent diverse populations, leading to biased outputs that can negatively affect marginalized students.
- **Impact of Missing Data**: The absence of data representing underrepresented groups can result in a lack of relevant educational resources and support.
- **Inaccurate Data Representation**: Misrepresentation of certain groups in training data can perpetuate stereotypes and hinder the effectiveness of educational tools.
- **Balancing Fairness with Performance**: Striking a balance between achieving high performance in language tasks while maintaining fairness is a complex challenge.

## Research Questions
To guide this project, the following research questions have been formulated:

1. How can we identify and mitigate biases present in existing LLMs used for educational purposes?
2. What methods can be employed to ensure that training datasets are representative of diverse student populations?
3. How does the missing representation of certain groups impact the effectiveness of LLMs in educational settings?
4. What strategies can be implemented to balance fairness and performance in AI-driven educational tools?

## Datasets Overview
The success of this project relies on utilizing diverse datasets that reflect the varied backgrounds of students. Key datasets include:

- **Common Crawl**: A vast dataset containing web pages from across the internet, which can be filtered for diversity.
- **OpenAI's GPT-3 Dataset**: Includes a wide range of text but requires careful curation to address bias.
- **Custom Educational Datasets**: Datasets specifically designed to include voices from underrepresented groups in education.

These datasets will be analyzed for bias and representation, ensuring that the models trained on them are more equitable.
